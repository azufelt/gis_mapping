# Overview

As a software engineer my goal is to incorporate useful tools into existing applications in an easy-to-use design in such a manner that end users won't require multiple programs and applications to accomplish desired tasks.

This map application features clickable map markers signifying trail heads that pop-up with additional information for the user. It also incorporates multiple layers to show trail routes in a solid line as well as park areas in a shaded tone.

My purpose in writing this software was such that oputdoor enthusiasts everywhere can have a quick reference of trails and trailheads in their area. As well as offer additional helpful information describing the chosen trail route.
